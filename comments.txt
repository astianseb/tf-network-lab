Assumption:
- organization exist
- cloud identity is configured
- bootstrap project will be provisioned with user credentials
- the rest of infra (lifecycle) will be provisioned with service account impersonation


Bootstrap project:
1. create special project under ORG for infra bootstraping ("tf-bootstrap")
enable following API's on this project:
    "orgpolicy.googleapis.com",
    "cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com",
    "cloudbilling.googleapis.com",
    "serviceusage.googleapis.com"

2. Create service account in project "tf-bootstrap"
    2a. Attach following roles to SA:
        "roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator",
        "roles/iam.serviceAccountUser"
2a. Impersonate Servcie Account (add me@sebastiang.eu as a principal)
3. Assign following IAM roles to Service Account under ORGANIZATION:
     "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin",
     "roles/orgpolicy.policyAdmin",
     "roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator",
     "roles/resourcemanager.folderCreator",
4. Output of bootstrap terraform is SA email address which needs to be used for impersonation

Lifecycle:
1. Terraform sets up:
    - org policy
    - folders
    - projects
2. Run terraform with impersonated service account:
        provider "google" {
        impersonate_service_account = "sg-tf-purposes@sg-staging-337311.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
                }
